    "Imagine you are building a program for a teacher who wants to track the progress of their students throughout the semester. The teacher wants to input the grades of each student one by one, and get a summary of their performance. There are in total 5 students. You are tasked with building the program that will allow the teacher to do this easily.\n",

    "The program will prompt the teacher to enter the grades of each student. Once the teacher has entered all the grades, the program will calculate the total sum of the grades and display it on the screen. Then, the program will create a new list by selecting only the grades of the first, third, and fifth students entered by the teacher, and sort them in ascending order.\n",
